You’ve seen the video, now you must decide. #speaker:Intra #audio:intra #portrait:intra_happy
Help SEA.E.O destroy this station and all the monsters. We guarantee that promotion for you, Employee 357.
If you stand against me, I will release these monsters to tear you apart. They have no humanity left.
